> > getting started with `chrome extension` build.

---

To get started to create extension you will need a `manifest.json` file.
This json file describes - extension's **capabilites and configuration**.

For Example:
most manifest files contain an `"action"` key which declares the image Chrome should use as the extesion's **_action's icon_**.
And the HTML page to show in a **popup** when the extension's action icon is clicked.
